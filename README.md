# tracking-lab

This code allows you to preform the calculations that will either add, subtract, multiply or devide two numbers. While doing so, the code will also track how many times you have calculated or used it's function.

How it works:

1. The code will first run the assert statments listed first thing in the main() to make sure that the code is running corrects. This allows me to see which part of my code isn't working and also allows me to see if the logic of my code is working correctly.
2. When all the assert statements pass, the code will prompt you into picking between +,-,* or / as yout operation. The user will then input which operation they want to use.
3. The code will then use the if and else statments to pick which function object to use depending on the operation the user has chose for their equation. 
4. The code will prompt the user to pick two numbers they would like to use this operation on then it will run through the function object to return the answer.
5. The code runs through the tracking class to update the number of times they used a function but also returns that same number on how many times they have ran it.
6. The user is asked if they want ot run the function once again and then they will be prompted back to the start. The code will keep looping and keeps adding how many times the user uses the function until the user types n for no when asked to go again.
